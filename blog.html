                        It is usually about viral infections that spread most easily in places where a large number of
                        children stay, ie in kindergartens and schools.
                        In addition to a runny nose, the initial symptoms of this infection include hoarseness or pain
                        in the throat. After a few days, a cough may appear due to the flow of secretions from the nose
                        to the throat. Increased temperature is also a sign that the child's body is fighting a viral
                        infection.
                        In this case, parents should be patient and allow the natural defense mechanisms to act at
                        first. According to pediatricians, the temperature up to 38OC should not be reduced. In the
                        following period, the condition and appearance of the child should be carefully monitored.
                        In addition to the viral infection, some children may also develop a bacterial infection. If the
                        child has not recovered after three or four days and seems more and more relaxed, then it is
                        most likely a bacterial infection. Then you should definitely see a doctor.
                        Bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics, which must always be prescribed by a doctor,
                        and the dosage depends on the child's body weight. Antibiotic therapy should always be carried
                        out to the end, that is, you should not stop it if you think that the child is better. However,
                        frequent use of antibiotics is not recommended, so it is best to take measures to prevent
                        bacterial infection at all. The first step is to strengthen immunity, especially in those
                        children who are more prone to colds.
                        Natural ways of strengthening immunity are also the most effective. This implies a proper and
                        healthy diet, rich in vitamins and minerals, enough sleep and regular stay in nature. Certain
                        plant-based preparations are also recommended as support for strengthening immunity.</div>

                        destination and many other open questions before setting off on the road.
                        When can you take the baby on a trip?

                        The answer is simple: After the first 2 months have passed, when the baby starts to progress
                        well in his weight and has no health problems - then he can go on a trip. But first you need to
                        satisfy some important conditions.

                        – First of all, you must have an adequate means of transportation – the best is a plane, an
                        air-conditioned car or a luxury sleeping room, if you are traveling by train.

                        – The destination you have chosen for travel should have all the necessary hygiene conditions,
                        as well as the services of a pediatrician, which you could use if necessary to examine your
                        baby.

                        – The place you will be should have a well-equipped pharmacy where you can find all the
                        necessary medicines (however, you could not take everything with you on vacation).

                        - Choose a destination from which you can return home really quickly and easily, if (God forbid)
                        the child falls ill with a more serious illness that needs appropriate treatment.


                        – Be in contact with your pediatrician who could advise you in case of possible problems.

                        Where is the best place to vacation with a baby?

                        Both sea and mountain are good choices. Although it is not easy to fit it into the home budget,
                        still choose what you like the most. A trip to the sea and a trip to the mountains are also good
                        for the baby. Usually, summer weather is better at the sea, and winter weather is better at the
                        mountains, but you can combine both variants. The child will fit in very easily, no worries!

                        Is it safe to travel by car?

                        There is no doubt that the plane is the fastest and most reliable means of travel to the place
                        you have chosen for vacation. However, if your choice is a car, then you should take care of
                        certain important things, so that the baby's journey is pleasant.

                        – Car seat

                        All major manufacturers of baby equipment also produce a seat for a baby, and newer models also
                        have their own offers for quality baby seats that fit ideally into the intended factory space.
                        The seat should be anatomically padded, and they must have safety belts.
                        – Air conditioning

                        If you don't have air conditioning in your car, you need to protect yourself and your children
                        from the heat during the trip. If you are a nocturnal bird, set off in the evening to arrive at
                        the site before the heat sets in. It is best for children to travel at night, but most drivers
                        do not want to travel after dark. Then, you should leave early in the morning, so that you spend
                        at least part of the journey in the cold.

                        – Windows

                        The windows should be only slightly "opened" to ensure the circulation of fresh air. It is not
                        at all healthy to do a longer draft that only looks good on you.

                        – Glass protectors

                        On the rear side windows, you should put good sun shades for windows, which significantly reduce
                        the penetration of UV rays. There are similar curtains designed for the rear window that are
                        transparent enough for drivers, but still make a solid shade for children.

                        – Liquids

                        When you go on the road, it is necessary to take enough fluids (juices and plain water) and
                        easily digestible food with you. Fruit is also desirable (bananas, apples), but you should not
                        overdo it, because you can "expel" your stomach from a lot of fruit.

                        – Breaks

                        You need to take breaks every 150-200 kilometers, if possible and more often, if the children
                        ask for it. Always take a break if you notice any health problems. The cold, sufficient amount
                        of water and 10 minutes of relaxation will come in handy so you can continue your journey.

                        – Possible problems

                        If the child vomits in the car, you should stop immediately and take a long break before
                        continuing the journey. To make it easier for him to bear the ride, it is ideal to give him a
                        light meal one hour before departure, and avoid rich and heavy food. Always, before the start of
                        the trip, put a clean mat (sheet or terrycloth) made of natural material on the back seat that
                        can be easily replaced if it gets dirty.</div>

                        <h1>Raising children</h1>
                    </div>
                    <div class="modal-body">Is there a more responsible task than raising children, older, more complex,
                        more beautiful?



                        How do we know if we have brought up our little angels well, if they need trust, love, initial
                        knowledge, education... and if it depends only on us or if it is their personality, character,
                        or something else.

                        For proper upbringing and proper development of the child, it is very important to create a warm
                        and comfortable home where they will feel comfortable and safe.

                        What is certain is that the family is the first school of life in which the child acquires the
                        basic knowledge about people, about their mutual relations, as well as about life and its
                        problems. These are actually the first experiences that the child will use later in life. That
                        is why raising children in the family is the most responsible task of every family member.

                        the consequences of inappropriate upbringing can be seen already in childhood. Wrong upbringing
                        discourages a child, makes him not independent, hinders his sense of community and leads him to
                        avoid responsibilities and work.

                        Success in education can only be achieved when we are self-critical of our educational mistakes,
                        if we have confidence in the child and if we love him. In order to make him independent faster,
                        we must make the child independent, that is we have to enable him to independently perform all
                        the non-duties that according to his age he can only perform. This is necessary to encourage the
                        child and instill confidence in his abilities. If necessary, help him, but never children's
                        responsibilities should be fully taken over.</div>
